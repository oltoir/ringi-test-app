# Ring-app

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## How to run project?

> I used `node` v20.8.0.

```bash
npm i
```
```bash
npm run start
```
> In the second terminal run json-server
```bash
npx json-serve db.json
```

## Project structure

For project structure was used [Feature Sliced Design](https://feature-sliced.design/).


## About project experience

For "Backend" I used json-server and react-query for queries.It was pleasure to work with [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/) for the first time, I had challenges only with design, because I didnt want to use figma and etc and designed components while developing.
